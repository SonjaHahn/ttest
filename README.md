# ttest
Compare two samples using a t-test based on sample sizes, means and sd-s (language: German)

This shiny app is supposed to be used for teaching and learning about inferential statistics on the basis of a t-test. 
It is based on sample characteristics, thereby allowing to compare the results to an existing data example and not relying directly
on concepts like theoretical (or population) characteristics underlying the samples. However, for a better understanding, these
concepts should be introduced along with this app.
